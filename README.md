## 📖 About The Project

**Riftbro** is an application aimed at making the process of managing your cards and decks for *Riftbound* a breeze. I want to enhance the beauty and fun of creating wild decks without the headache of manual tracking.

Gone are the days of arguing over rule specifics or wondering how many matches you've actually won. I built Riftbro to put the rulebook and your stats right in your pocket.

> **Current Status:** Closed Alpha (Testing with my local community of 4).

## ✨ Key Features (Version 1.0)

### 🔌 Official Data Integration
* **Powered by Riftbound API:** I intend to integrate the official **Riftbound API** to dynamically fetch high-fidelity card assets, rule text, and meta updates directly from the developers. This will ensure the database is always synchronized with the live game.

### 🃏 Deck Building & Collection
* **Wild Deck Creation:** A fluid interface to craft the craziest decks imaginable using real-time data.
* **Collection Manager:** Track which cards you own and see exactly how close you are to 100% completion.

### 📊 Statistics Tracking
* **Personal Stats:** Visualize your win/loss ratio.
* **Deck Analysis:** Get detailed statistics on your custom builds to optimize your strategy.

### 📚 The Compendium
* **Pocket Rulebook:** A complete, searchable database of effects and descriptions.
* **Conflict Solver:** Detailed descriptions to settle those "confusion" moments during matches with friends.
